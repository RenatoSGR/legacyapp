# Modernize a Legacy Application with GitHub Copilot

This is a legacy application that is being migrated to the cloud. 

![image](./content/appmodernization-ai.jpg)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [GitHub Copilot Extension](https://copilot.github.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)

## Challenge

For running this challenge, please checkout the [demo branch](https://github.com/RenatoSGR/legacyapp/tree/demo) and do the next steps and GitHub Copilot prompts under that branch, since this main branch already has all the code and actions needed to deploy the application to Azure Container Apps, with the full solution already implemented. 

### The Application
The application is a simple album catalog that consists of two parts:

- Album API: A .NET Core Web API that provides CRUD operations for albums.
- Album UI: A React application that consumes the Album API.

The Album API is a legacy application that is running on a Windows Server 2016 VM. The Album UI is a legacy application that is running on a Windows Server 2016 VM.

The goal is to modernize and migrate the Album API and Album UI to the cloud.

### Architecture and Scenario

![image](./content/arch-legapp.png)

After a successful containerization of the Album API and Album UI, the next step is to push the container images to a container registry and deploy the containers to an Azure Service that can host the Album API and Album UI as containers.

For this challenge, we will use Azure Container Apps to host the Album API and Album UI.

Find more information about **Azure Container Apps** [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/).

## Running locally the application

### Album API
To run the albumapi:

```shell
cd containerapps-albumapi-csharp/src
dotnet run
```

### Album UI

Install cross-env:
```shell
npm install --global cross-env
```
Install npm dependencies:

```shell
cd containerapps-albumui/src
npm install
```
Run album ui:
```shell
npm run start
```

**Note** to connect the Album UI to the Album API, you need to update the `process.env.API_BASE_URL` in the `.env` file iorder to point to the Album API URL.

## Using GitHub Copilot to modernize the application

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It draws context from the code you‚Äôre working on and suggests whole lines or entire functions. You can try GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code by installing the GitHub Copilot extension.

### Success criteria

üéØ Show the Album Application containerized and running in Azure (eg: in a AKS, ACA, App Services)

### Instructions

### 1. Setup your environment

Make sure the following extensions are installed in your Visual Studio Code:

- GitHub Copilot
- GitHub Copilot Chat

### 2. Clone the repository

aka.ms/gh-legacyapp

### 3. Modernize the Album Application

#### 3.1 Let's start interact with GitHub Copilot to modernize the application.

> Did you know that GitHub Copilot can provide information about your current workspace on VScode?


> 
> `@workspace can you explain what projects are in this workspace?`
</details>
<br/>  

#### 3.2 Now let's modernize the Album Application.

> 

> `@workspace I want to modernize my two projects, and with that, I want a Dockerfile for each one. For the containerapps-albumapi-csharp project, use the sdk 6 version and expose the api on port 8080. For the containerapps-albumui app expose the ui under port 3000`
</details>
<br/>  

#### 3.3 let's ask GitHub Copilot to help us explaining the Dockerfiles.

> 

> `Hit ctrl+I inside the Dockerfile previously created and after select all code hit /explain to see the explanation of the code.`
</details>
<br/>  


#### 3.4 Now let's build the Docker images for the Album API and Album UI.

### 4. Deploy the Album Application to Azure

#### 4.1 Push the changes to your GitHub repository.

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "Modernize the Album Application"
git push
```

#### 4.2 Create the secrets and variables that are needed for the GitHub Actions workflow.

- AZURE_CREDENTIALS: The Azure service principal credentials.
- CONTAINE_REGISTRY_NAME: The name of the Azure Container Registry.
- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME: The username of the Azure Container Registry.
- CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD: The password of the Azure Container Registry.

#### 4.3 Run the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the Album Application to Azure Container Apps.

Under the Actions tab in your GitHub repository, you will see the GitHub Actions workflow that was created. Click on the workflow and then click on the Run workflow button to start the deployment process.

#### 4.4 Access the Album Application running in Azure.

After the deployment process is completed, you can access the Album Application running in Azure by navigating to the URL provided by Azure Container Apps.
